## Introduction

This example demonstrates how to use the **RA8 series MCU SDHI module (r_sdhi)** on the **Titan Board** to drive the **CYWL6208-GS WiFi module**, enabling wireless network connectivity via the SDIO interface.
 In this example, the MCU communicates with the CYWL6208-GS module (chip CYW43438) through the **SDIO bus**, and integrates with the RT-Thread network stack (lwIP) to achieve TCP/IP network functionality.

## WiFi Introduction

### 1. Overview

**WiFi (Wireless Fidelity)** is a wireless local area network (WLAN) communication technology based on the **IEEE 802.11 standard**.
 It transmits data between terminal devices (such as MCUs, smartphones, PCs, or IoT devices) and access points (APs) via radio waves, providing **short-range high-speed wireless communication**.

WiFi is currently one of the most widely used wireless technologies, commonly applied in home networks, office networks, industrial control, smart homes, and IoT devices.

### 2. Working Principle

1. **Communication Method**
   - WiFi uses the **ISM bands** (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz) and modulation schemes such as **OFDM, DSSS, and QAM** for data transmission.
   - WiFi networks consist of **Access Points (APs)** and **Stations (STAs)**.
2. **Data Transmission Flow**
   - The STA scans for available WiFi networks.
   - STA sends authentication and association requests.
   - The AP completes handshake and key negotiation.
   - Once a secure communication channel is established between STA and AP, data transmission occurs.

### 3. WiFi Standards

Different WiFi versions correspond to the IEEE 802.11 standards:

| Standard              | Frequency Band | Max Rate | Features                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **802.11b**           | 2.4 GHz        | 11 Mbps  | Early version, poor interference resistance       |
| **802.11g**           | 2.4 GHz        | 54 Mbps  | Backward compatible with 802.11b                  |
| **802.11n (WiFi 4)**  | 2.4/5 GHz      | 600 Mbps | MIMO technology                                   |
| **802.11ac (WiFi 5)** | 5 GHz          | 3.5 Gbps | MU-MIMO, 80/160 MHz channels                      |
| **802.11ax (WiFi 6)** | 2.4/5/6 GHz    | 9.6 Gbps | OFDMA, lower latency, higher concurrency          |
| **802.11be (WiFi 7)** | 2.4/5/6 GHz    | >30 Gbps | Multi-link operation (MLO), ultra-high throughput |

### 4. WiFi Modes

- **STA mode (Station)**: Device connects to an AP.
- **AP mode (Access Point)**: Device provides network access as a hotspot.
- **P2P mode (Peer-to-Peer/Ad-Hoc)**: Direct device-to-device communication.
- **Hybrid mode**: Both STA and AP functions coexist.

### 5. WiFi Security

- **WEP** (deprecated, insecure)
- **WPA/WPA2**: TKIP/AES-based encryption, mainstream security
- **WPA3**: Enhanced security, supports SAE handshake to prevent brute-force attacks

### 6. WiFi Characteristics

#### Advantages

- High-speed transmission (Gbps level)
- Widely supported (phones, PCs, MCUs, etc.)
- Low cost, mature ecosystem
- Can connect multiple devices simultaneously

#### Disadvantages

- High power consumption, unsuitable for ultra-low-power applications
- Limited transmission range (typically 10–100 m)
- 2.4 GHz band prone to interference (Bluetooth, microwave ovens, etc.)

## RA8 Series SDHI Module Introduction

The **RA8 series MCU SDHI (SD Host Interface) module** is a host controller compliant with **SD/SDIO/eMMC standards**, capable of communicating with storage devices (SD card, eMMC) or SDIO peripherals (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth modules) via **1-bit or 4-bit data lines**.

In **storage applications**, it functions as an SD/eMMC controller for high-speed read/write operations. In **peripheral expansion applications**, it acts as an SDIO host to establish data channels with WiFi, Bluetooth, GNSS, and other modules.

In this example, SDHI is used to drive the **CYWL6208-GS WiFi module (SDIO interface)** to enable wireless networking for the MCU.

## Compilation & Download

* **RT-Thread Studio**: In RT-Thread Studio’s package manager, download the Titan Board resource package, create a new project, and compile it.

After compilation, connect the development board’s USB-DBG interface to the PC and download the firmware to the development board.

## Run Effect

Press the reset button to restart the development board, if the terminal output firmware read error information, then you need to use **ymodem** to download WiFi firmware to Flash. Use the `whd_res_download whd_firmware` command to download `43438A1.bin` into the `whd_firmware` partition of Flash; Use the `whd_res_download whd_clm` command to download `43438A1.clm_blob` into the `whd_clm` partition of the Flash.

The WiFi firmware can be found in the `/firmware` folder of the project root.

![image-20250814183443630](figures/image-20250814183443630.png)

After downloading the WiFi firmware, reset the Titan Board, and you can see that the WiFi firmware is loaded normally and the WiFi module is initialized successfully. Then type `wifi join TitanBoard 12345678` to connect to WiFi and `ping baidu.com` to ping test.
